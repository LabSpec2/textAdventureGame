	<div class="main-text">
		
		<p>You have found a kitchen. It's rather narrow, with a long countertop stretching along the wall opposite to you. One of the shorter walls is entirely covered by a massive stone oven. </p>
		<p>There are two doors behind you, the simple door that leads into the hall and a more decorated one. The other wall is covered in cupboards of different sizes, with doors mostly open, some of them hanging by a single hinge. You can see a stash of rather
			 bruised and wrinkled <button id="apple" name="apple" class="text_buttons">apples</button> in one of them. </p>
		<p>Above the countertop hang bundles of dry and crackly twigs, that might have been herbs. Next to the withered greens hangs a braid of surprisingly 
			fresh looking <button id="garlic" name="garlic" class="text_buttons">garlic</button>. </p>
		<p>A mouse brushes against your ankle.</p>
